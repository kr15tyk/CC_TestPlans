The testplans repository is setup to use a YAML file to generate custom NDcPPv3.0 test plans.

Follow these steps to generate a custom test plan:

1. Fork repository and give it a unique name
2. Check permissions, Settings>Actions>WorkFlow Permissions> Read and write
3. Delete any SFRs you don't want in your Testplan
4. Select 'Actions' from the top menu
5. Select the 'Combine Asciidoc, Convert to HTML, and Commit' workflow
6. Select 'Run workflow'
7. Return to main Repo page and download 'combined-test plan.adoc and/or testplan.html docs

Note: It's recommended that you use a new fork of the test plans repository for each custom test plan you need to generate.
