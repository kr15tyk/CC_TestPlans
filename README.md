This repository uses a YAML file to generate custom NDcPPv3.0 test plans.

Follow these steps to generate a custom test plan:

1. Select the 'Use this template' button, select create a new repository, then provide a unique name.
2. Check your repository permissions by going to Settings>Actions>WorkFlow Permissions> Read and write.
3. You may consider creating a new branch from main for each custom test plan.
4. Delete any .adoc SFRs files you do not want included in your test plan.
5. Select the 'Actions' button from the menu.
6. Select the 'Combine Asciidoc, Convert to HTML, and Commit' workflow.
7. Select 'Run workflow'. You can watch the status of the workflow as it runs.
8. Return to your repository's main page and download the 'combined-testplan.adoc' and/or 'testplan.html' documents.

NOTE: It's recommended that you create a new template from this repository for each custom test plan you need to generate.
