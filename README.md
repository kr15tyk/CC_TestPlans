The testplans repository is setup to use a YAML file to generate custom NDcPPv3.0 test plans.

Follow these steps to generate a custom test plan:

1. Fork this repository and give it a unique name.
2. Check your repository permissions by going to Settings>Actions>WorkFlow Permissions> Read and write.
3. Delete any .adoc SFRs files you do not want included in your test plan.
4. Select the 'Actions' button from the menu.
5. Select the 'Combine Asciidoc, Convert to HTML, and Commit' workflow.
6. Select 'Run workflow'. You can watch the status of the workflow as it runs.
7. Return to your repository's main page and download the 'combined-test plan.adoc' and/or 'testplan.html' documents.

Note: It's recommended that you use a new fork of the testplans repository for each custom test plan you need to generate.
